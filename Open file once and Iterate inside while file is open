// One solution is to open a file once and then iterate inside the function while the file is open:
temperatures = [10,-20,-289,100] 
def writer(temperatures):
    with open("temps.txt", 'w') as file:
        for c in temperatures:
            if c > -273.15:
                f = c* 9/5 + 32
                file.write(str(f) + "\n")
writer(temperatures) #Here we're calling the function, otherwise no output will be generated
